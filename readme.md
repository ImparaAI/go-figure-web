# Go Figure Web App

Angular web app for Go Figure where you can draw a continuous line and watch a Fourier circle drawing approximating the path. This is used in conjunction with the [backend API](https://github.com/ImparaAI/go-figure-api) and is inspired by the [Fourier series circle drawings video by 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k).
